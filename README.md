predictsr fetches the latest version of the open-access
[PREDICTS](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/research/projects/predicts.html)
database extract from the [Natural History Museum Data
Portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/).

The PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing
Terrestrial Systems) dataset comprises 4,318,808 measurements, from
35,736 sampling locations in 101 countries and 54,863 species, taken
across two releases: one in
[2016](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database-v1-1)
and another in
[2022](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022).

The data were collated from spatial comparisons of local-scale
biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic
pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world, and are described in
Hudson et. al.Â (2016) (<doi:10.1002/ece3.2579>).

This package accesses the latest version of the open-access database as
a dataframe, and is under active development.

## Installation

Installation from CRAN proceeds as usual:

    install.packages("predictsr")

You can also install the development version of predictsr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    # install.packages("pak")
    pak::pak("Biodiversity-Futures-Lab/predictsr")

Then as usual just load the package:

    library(predictsr)

## Usage

To pull in the database and get the data, use the `GetPredictsData`
function:

    predicts <- GetPredictsData()

which by default will read in the 2016 and 2022 data, as a dataframe.

To read in the site-level summaries:

    summaries <- GetSitelevelSummaries()

which will also, by default, read in the 2016 and 2022 data, as a
dataframe.

To read in the descriptions of the columns of the database extract:

    columns <- GetColumnDescriptions()

which will give you a dataframe on the information on the columns that
are in the database extract.

## Notes

The Natural History Museum cannot warrant the quality or accuracy of the
data.

This package builds upon the [NHM data portal
API](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/about/download), which by default has no API
rate limits. Please respect this and be responsible with your access.
